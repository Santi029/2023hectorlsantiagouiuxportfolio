                            During the transition from wireframes into the final design I create prototypes simulating

                        <p>In my experience A / B testing means that during the UI / UX process you will find or
                            confront two or more solutions for the same component or segment and both could be really
                            enjoyable for clients, co-workers, managers or stakeholders. If we have this situation and
                            those two options survive the whole process, maybe, if the company has the time and
                            resources to try all the different solutions, it will be great to present those options to
                            the customer and they can decide the best option for them.</p>

        <p>After having gone through all the processes of research, analysis, ideation, wireframe, prototyping and
            everything is approved, the next step is the development process. At this point it is very important to have
            already incorporated the development team in all the meetings to make it part of the process. For them this
            is very important because they would be clear about how this application or solution is suppose to be built.
            The developer is expected not to indicate how he would create the application but to listen to the ideas and
            ask questions to see how he can create this solution that the design team is trying to create and at this
            point we have a tangible solution but is not final. Designers try in each new solution to bring it to the
            present with new trends and solutions so that the final result is an experience in keeping with the times.
            At the same time we must cooperate with the developers so that they can understand which was the design
            accepted by all and additionally all subsequent changes. After having achieved expected changes, we must
            review each work carried out by the developers and if more adjustments are needed, tell the developer that
            we need more changes, so it is good to clarify with the developer what solutions and plugins we can use
            together for a better transition and avoid the end have a lot of changes for not reaching the expected end.
