            <p>Problem solving. At the end of this phase you’ll have a pixel perfect design for your app or website. During the transition from wireframes into the final design I create prototypes simulating final end results before development.</p>

        <div id="wireframe" class="tabcontent">
            <h1>Wireframe</h1>
            <p>Bringing designs to life. Since I’m a designer who can code too, I can easily work in close collaboration with developers up until the finish line and beyond. In case of web projects I also do front-end development.</p>

            <h1>Development</h1>
            <p>After having gone through all the processes of research, analysis, ideation, wireframe, prototyping and
                everything is approved, the next step is the development process. At this point it is very important to
                have already incorporated the development team in all the meetings to make it part of the process. For them
                this is very important because they would be clear about how this application or solution is suppose to be
                built. The developer is expected not to indicate how he would create the application but to listen to the ideas
                and ask questions to see how he can create this solution that the design team is trying to create and at
                this point we have a tangible solution but is not final. Designers try in each new solution to bring it to
                the present with new trends and solutions so that the final result is an experience in keeping with the
                times. At the same time we must cooperate with the developers so that they can understand which was the design
                accepted by all and additionally all subsequent changes. After having achieved expected changes, we must
                review each work carried out by the developers and if more adjustments are needed, tell the developer
                that we need more changes, so it is good to clarify with the developer what solutions and plugins we can use
                together for a better transition and avoid the end have a lot of changes for not reaching the expected
                end.</p>

            <h1>Test and Re-test</h1>
            <p>Transparent process. Complete overview of my design process through regular meetings. After the initial design versions I’m happy to do user testing with your customers to ensure the best possible solutions for their needs.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="abtesting" class="tabcontent">
            <h1>A/B Testing</h1>
            <p>In my experience A / B testing means that during the UI / UX process you will find or confront two or more solutions for the same component or segment and both could be really enjoyable for clients, co-workers, managers or stakeholders. If we have this situation and those two options survive the whole process, maybe, if the company has the time and resources to try all the different solutions, it will be great to present those options to the customer and they can decide the best option for them.</p>
